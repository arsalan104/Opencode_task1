solution of question 1:
Git and GitHub-
Git is a version control system. It is a software tool that helps you manage the different versions of your code files and track changes. With Git, you can keep a
history of changes, revert to previous versions, and collaborate with other developers by sharing changes with one another.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, as well as tools for bug tracking, project management, and collaboration.
It makes it easier for developers to store and share their code, as well as track issues, manage pull requests, and build software. In other words,
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides an interface for Git repositories and allows for easy collaboration and code sharing.




solution of que 2:
five basic Git commands:
1.git commit: This command is used to save changes to the local Git repository. When you run git commit, Git creates a new "commit" with a message 
that describes the changes you made. 
2. git clone: This command is used to copy an existing Git repository from a remote source to your local machine. For example, you can use git clone 
to download a repository from GitHub.
3. git add: This command is used to add files to the staging area, which is a temporary holding place for changes that you want to commit.
4. git init: This command is used to initialize a new Git repository. It creates a new directory with all the necessary Git files to track changes in your code.
5. git push: This command is used to upload your local Git repository to a remote repository, such as a server on GitHub. When you run git push, 
your changes are sent to the remote repository and made available to other collaborators.


3.  way to propose changes to a project that is hosted on a remote repository
1. for making a pull request:
2. Fork the repository on GitHub.
3. Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
4. Create a new branch for your changes.
5. Make the changes to the code.
6. Commit and push the changes to the forked repository.
7. Open a pull request on the original repository.
8. Wait for the repository maintainers to review and accept your changes.
